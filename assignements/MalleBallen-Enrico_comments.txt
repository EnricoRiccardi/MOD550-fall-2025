Git repo: it works, but too may files around. I should just see what I need to check.  
I only checked the notebook with Task1.

Readme.md: good, but you forgot to say a bit about you.

Task 1.1: good, but you could use your own class to generate the source data also.

Task 1.2: good, very drammatic colors also :) 

Task 1.3: There are errors here: e.g. NameError: name 'path' is not defined

Task 1.4:  

Task 1.5: Missing

Comment:
The DataAquisition class miss DOCSTRING! 
Task 1,5 is missing. Please complete it before next assigment.

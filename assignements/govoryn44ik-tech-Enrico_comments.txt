Git repo: it works, but too may files around. I should just see what I need to check.  
I only checked the notebook with Task1.

Readme.md: way too poor.

Task 1.1: you made a heatmap here.

Task 1.2: ok

Task 1.3: Missing

Task 1.4: Missing 

Task 1.5: Missing

Comment:
Non sufficient. You have until 26.9 to fix it or it is a fail. A fail means that you cannot take the exam.

Task 1 and 2 smells of AI generated code... I didn't mention it, but if ou used AI you should write a statement on how AI has been used. If I use an AI detector on your code and I get that it is mostly AI generated, it would be considered cheating (that is, automatic fail for the whole course).

Git repo: it works, but too may files around. I should just see what I need to check.  Also, it is 1Gb of data, too much to a git (code sharing) repository. Consider to reduce it to a base minimum to still be able to complete the present task.
I only checked the notebook with classes.

Readme.md: good.

Task 1.1: you made a heatmap here.

Task 1.2: ok

Task 1.3: Keep the notebook clean, I do not need to see test.csv is as follows:...

Task 1.4: this is 1D histogram. The idea was to use task 1.1. to plot here.

Task 1.5: you have only one distribution?

Comment:
You miss docstring in your data_aquisition class. 

It look good and proper use of import, so that is good. 

It is very ordered and it smels of AI generated code... I didn't mention it, but if ou used AI you should write a statement on how AI has been used.
